# Work Logs

This directory contains automatically generated work notes from the SuperVM Work Logger extension.

## Structure

Each work note follows this naming pattern:
```
WORK-NOTE-YYYY-MM-DD-{sessionId}.md
```

Example:
```
WORK-NOTE-2026-02-06-3a7f2c91.md
```

## Contents

Each work note includes:
- Session metadata (date, duration, status)
- Conversation summary (if Copilot Chat captured)
- Actions performed (files created/modified/deleted)
- Statistics (lines changed, modules affected)
- File change list with modules
- Verification checklist

## Usage

Work notes are generated automatically when you end a work session:

1. Work on files (auto-tracked)
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+L` to end session
3. Work note created here
4. Changelog entry added to `tools/work-logger/mylog/changelog.db`

## Viewing

You can:
- Browse notes in VS Code file explorer
- Use "Work Logger: Open Worklogs" command
- View from end session notification

## Indexing

The Work Logger maintains an index of all sessions in `INDEX-WORKLOGS.md` (auto-generated).
